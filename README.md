    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stellarframe.git
    cd stellarframe
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project for local development. You can copy the example:
    ```sh
    cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
    ```

    Open `.dev.vars` and add your Cloudflare AI Gateway credentials. You can find these in your Cloudflare Dashboard.

    ```ini
    # .dev.vars
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"
    CF_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY"
    ```

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment to Cloudflare Pages.
